0,Interesting information..,1 person won't make a difference,,,,,,,Not interested in government spending ,,,,1 person won't make a difference,1 person won't make a difference,,I do that already,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,This is a good point as I didn't realise there was plastic in cigarette butts.,,,,,,,,,,,I don't believe they are that harmful to wildlife.,More about environmental impact than giving up smoking. I think if someone wants to smoke then they wouldn't be too bothered about the damage they cause to the environment.,,Most smokers wouldn't be too bothered about this as they don't throw that many away each.,This message is basically telling you not to litter with your cigarette butts. As such I don't think it would have any impact at all on motivating someone to quit smoking.,This would have more of an impact on me as I would like to be able to breathe better. Not sure if it would be the clincher to giving up though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,This aspect of smoking has not been something that I have thought about previously. I have always made an effort not to litter bu the idea of them being a form of plastic litter is a new one to me and at this point is not important to me and my smoking habit,As my previous reply this aspect of smoking has not been one that I have thought about previously,,,,,,,,See previous replies ,As before,,I don't flick my butts so this message has no relevance to me,,,I do dispose of my butts responsibly so feel that this message is not one that resonated with me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,,,,,,"It would make no difference to me as a smoker, it encourages smoking",I don't throw cigarettes on the ground anyway,,,,,,I don't throw my cigarette butts on the ground - doesn't feel relevant,,,Doesn't seem to be focused on quitting smoking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,,,,,This offer would not attract me as an individual ,I do use the bin to avoid being fined ,,I know itâ€™s expensive to clear away litter but people need to learn to use the bin which is what I do.,I knew cigarettes littering is very common and is no surprise that this is the highest type of litter found in the streets etc,This would not affect me as I have a habit of smoking and a lot of people smoke so I donâ€™t worry about the environment.,,,,,I do this already therefore would not convince me to stop smoking ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,I smoke roll ups,,,It does make me feel bad although all my ends go into my bin,,Giving me an ashtray is in no way making me want to stop or encouraging me,,,,,,,Doesn't sound true,,Is that more than nail clippings?,I only smoke at home so I clean them anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,,"Rather than make me quit, I would be asking tobacco companies to find a solution to this issue",,,,"This doesn't motivate me to quit,it is just a helpful message",,,,,,,There should be harsher penalties for those caught acting irresponsble,"Again I understand the environmental issue, but it doesn't motivate me massively as there are so many other environmental issues,which I generally do help with","I do understand the litter issue, but I'm usually responsible and don't feel it commit to this problem. Chewing Gum is almost as bad in my opinion and is so hard to clean up, so feel this aims to demonise smokers.","I always dispose of cigarettes in the correct manner, so not massively motivational, although it does remind me that it isn't the cleanest of habits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,,No comments same as before ,This actually really annoys me! I would love people not to ruin the beaches ,,,,,,,,Doesnâ€™t make me want to stop smoking ,Doesnâ€™t make me want to stop smoking however I will be more careful in future if I throw a cigarette ,,,Doesnâ€™t really make me want to stop smoking. I think that measures need to be put in place to dispose of them. ,Doesnâ€™t make me want to stop smoking but I dispose properly anyway ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,,This might tug on the heart strings of people and make them consider quitting,I personally clean up my butts and this wouldnâ€™t make me change anything I already do.,,,It would just make me consider getting a personal ashtray ,,,,"Again, I clean up my own butts and rarely litter in general. It is unlikely to affect my actions.",,,,This is more like to make me quit as it gives a better view of the amount of impact I have as a smoker to the wider environment,,A good number of the smokers I know already do this. It wouldnâ€™t make me want to quit though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,,,I am surprised the figure is so high,,,,As long as there are adequate provisions of bins and ashtrays there is no reason to drop them on the streets,the majority of cigarette filters never make it as far as the water so the risk posed to water quality is minimal,it motivates me to put butts in a bin,,,if this is true why has it never been publicised,,,,it encourages me to make sure I tidy up but not to quit smoking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,I DONT THINK THATS TRUE ,,,,DOESNT REALLY WANT TO  MAKE ME WANNA GIE UP JUST COS THE FILTERS TAKE 12 YEARS DEGRADE,,,NOT SURE,CAN GET FINED NOW FOR DROPPING FAG BUTTS SO NOT AS MANY PEOPLE WILL DO IT ,,,,,,,I ALWAYS DO ANYWAY ,THINGS LIKE THIS COULD MAKE ME GIVE UP A LOT MORE THAN HOW LONG A FILTER TAKES TO DEGRADE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"I would like to be more eco friendly , i never really thought about pollution from the actual cigarette ends ",,,,,I wasn't aware you could do this,"I would definitely be more careful, i dont really like throwing them on the street but i thought they just decomposed  ",,,,,it doesn't stop me because i would just be more careful with how i expose of it ,,I wouldnt think that it would contaminate much water so it would make me think twice about how i dispose of them ,,"it does not sound negative, ti does not change my motivation really ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,How are they plastic?,,,,,I had no idea about this,,,,Yes well there are a lot of smokers,,,,,Makes sense,That is a good idea,I had no idea this was the case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,,,Shows the real harm that smoking on beaches does ,,,,,There is no definite in the message so definitely doesnâ€™t give any motivation to quit ,,,The amount of chemicals seems ridiculously high ,,,,Itâ€™s a habit so wonâ€™t be easily stopped. ,Itâ€™s just a statement. No push in it. ,Itâ€™s good that you can get some health back after quitting ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,,"dont want to harm marine life, but dont think it makes a difference",,,,,,,,,health is the least of my worries - i am past the 'good health' scenario and must accept what my life long smoking has done to me,,i dont personally flick my butts,"an exaggerated 'fact', which i dont believe",everyone needs to have attention on how they dispose of butts,i dispose of my butts responsibly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,,Environmental issues are a huge concern.,Environmental issues are a serious concern.,,Environmental issues are a serious concern.,A free ashtray wouldn't make me want to quit.,,,This is a persuasive argument because it shows how smoking affects others.,,,,,,,Has no bearing on wanting to quit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,,,,This is quite emotional to read and it shows how your actions are affecting animals which makes me want to quit,This is a hard hitting fact which makes me feel bad about smoking and dropping the butt but it doesn't make me really active in wanting to quit,This just encourages me to smoke more because it makes life easier for me.,This doesn't make me want to quit it just makes me remember not to drop a butt on the floor.,,,"This makes me feel bad about the environment but it doesn't necessarily make me think, ""I will quit smoking now.""",,,,,,This doesn't make me want to quit at all.. This has nothing to do with my own health.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,,That is nasty but I don't smoke cigarettes with filters,,,,,,,I get rid of my tobacco waste responsibly,,,,,"Not as bad plastic which takes much longer, also I smoke rollups without a filter",It may be true but doesn't put me off smoking. I bin my butts. ,good idea but not motivational to stop,It is a good reason to stop but while my health is ok I'll carry on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,,"Again, makes me think about the damaging chemicals in cigarettes and their effect on me and other animals. ",,,,,,,"I hate to think of myself as a burden on society, but itâ€™s a good point - all those cigarette butts have to get cleaned up. ","I hadnâ€™t realised that cigarette butts were such a massive pollutant, but it stands to reason. They should make them from degradable material. ",,Makes me think about the harmful effects on myself as well as on wildlife. ,Horrible to think of cigarette butts adding to all the plastic waste on our beaches. ,,,I generally use a bin. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,,Fine,,,Maybe,,That's nice,"I agree that the first part is likely, but would like to know the evidence for the second bit. Also., and this is a bit picky, it should be ""contaminate"" rather than ""contaminates""...",,,,,References?,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,,,,,,,I WILL ENSURE THAT I AM CRAEFUL WHEN SMOKING TO AVOID RECIEVING A FINE ,,,,"AGREED HOWEVER, IT IS HARD TO QUIT SMOKING AFTERSO MANY YEARS",,,,,I AGREE WITH THIS STATEMENT ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,I feel guilty about the effect on the environment.,,,,,,Iâ€™d be more interested in ensuring I donâ€™t litter.,"I want to do more to help  the environment, because itâ€™s having an effect on everyone.",,,,,,This is a horrifying thought to think of. ,,Be responsible about littering.,"I didnâ€™t know that lungs cleared themselves, and it makes me think that I should try harder to quit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,not suprising ,,sad that the ocean is full of plastics,,,,good incentive to get people to either not smoke or smoke in a designated area,i remember there have been studies proving plastics found in fish and drinking water.,,,,,,,not suprising. ,sensible message. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,,,,,It's doesn't sound good,,,,It's probably about same as normal littering,,Not sure if tobacco roll ups are better then cigarettes,,People should dispose of them better. But there are less and less bins in general nowadays,,,I agree,It is hard to give up and stay given up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,"It's awful, but the fact that I ALWAYS throw mine in a bin means it doesn't motivate me personally.",,Same answer as previous,"Again, proper disposal is more of a message",,"No I didn't, so, thanks!",,,,,it's more a deterrent to dispose of butts correctly!,,,,,Couldn't agree more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,,,"good concept, but 19-38% is just such a vague number and is not credible",,,,,,no more than chewing gum!,,,"again a good concept, but leachate sounds a made up word, just specify what actually leaches out",just not credible,"just doesn't sound credible, specify what the contaminants are",,"a clear message, but who uses a pocket ashtray?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,,I do care but I donâ€™t use cigarette butts I smoke tobacco ,I think thatâ€™s quite shocking ,,,,,I donâ€™t smoke filter cigarettes ,,,,,,I think thatâ€™s terrible but doesnâ€™t motivate me personally ,,I agree with this message but it doesnâ€™t help to quit ,I think thatâ€™s a useful message and does motivate me ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,This surprised me,,I donot smoke on the beach,,This is very surprising,,,,I am not surprised,,,This is tragic,,,,It is the right thing to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,,I care about the environment ,,I feel bad about this as i care about animals ,,,,,,depends which country but i imagine from the sheer numbers that this would be true,,,I do feel slightly guilty when flicking cigarette butts in the floor,,,yes i dont like seeing cigarette butts on the floor,I know this is the case and mainly smoke e cigarettes these days but still addicted to nicotine. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,,,,,I find that motivating because it hits home the point that the pollution still exists regardless off trying to dispose of them correctly,,I completely support the fine but it makes me cautious about disposal and doesn't speak to my desire to quit,,,,,"Highly motivating, it makes me want to wipe them from existence and do my part to make it happen",I am aware of this problem and it has certainly motivated me to dispose of my butts carefully but unfortunately hasn't made me quit,,,Again it motivates me to dispose of butts correctly but not quit,I do find it motivational to know that there is a perceptible improvement so quickly but it hasn't stopped me thus far,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,,"Cigarettebutts are the most common form of litter,as an  estimated 4.5 trilioncigarette butts are thrown away every year worldwide.Many chemical prodcts are used during the course of growing tobacco and manufacturing cigarettes prepared for consumption.","yes,correct.You can see them not only on the beaches.They are everywhereThe chemicals found in one cigarette butt can leach out and contaminate appr. 7.5 littres of water per hour.",,,i didnt know it but now i gonna do it.,,,,"Yes as i said before they are everywhere-on the street,beaches,watere etc.",,,,,The cigarette butts are the biggest Ocean contaminant.They are polluting the environment,yes i do that in the bin f i am out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,,If its harming marine life too then yes,,I think smokers need to be more mindful of where they doing.,,,,"It wasnt a massive 100, kind of in between",,,Thats alot of chemicals and for that reasons its 100,,"Thats just awful, why do people do it.",,,nothing really to add,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,,,,Again I have never thought what happens to the butts or where they go once I dispose of them. This is heart breaking thinking about it. ,,,,,,,We need to try and reduce the amount of toxic fumes in the air. ,I didn't know this. Didn't really think about what happens to the butts ,"We need to respect the planet, not destroy it",We need to reduce the amount of toxic waste we are using,,I always try to dispose of them in a bin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,,,,,I am sure thus is also true ,,,Probably again true,,Probably nit as true as it once was,I am sure thus is true,,,,I never throw my cigarette butts,I always make sure I do this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,,,,,,,,,that doesn't surprise me though nowadays there are so many bins around with ashtrays on the top I don't know why people don't use them,,interesting,,I didn't know that nor have I ever thought of where they end up,disgusting,,there is no reason why people wouldn't its just pure laziness,it is an eyeopener ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,,,It isn't nice to think of beaches and the clean ait being polluted by cigarette butts.,,,,,,I doubt that tobacco waste is the most significant waste.,"I doubt this is true, there will be some cigarette butts but I doubt that it is the largest type of litter.",,I am no sure if this is scientifically proven but I am an animal lover so this motivates me.,,,"Nowadays, cigarette butts are less common, I see more chewing gum and drink bottles littering. I do not drop cigarette butts so this message does not really motivate me","I agree, dropping cigarette  buts is revolting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,This message is important as a smoker you don't realise the cigarettes contain plastic,,That's a lot of litter it has made me want to join a beach clean,,,"I wasn't aware of this scheme, I always place my butts in a public bin I don't put them on the floor",,That's not something I even contemplated ,,,,,,,,I always put butts in a bin never on the floor,I was aware of this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,,I did not know this fact and motivates me to want to stop smoking.,,,,"Yes I have picked up one of these ashtrays in my local council before,it helps keep my town clean.",,"I also did not know this fact, it's not fair to people who do not smoke.",,Smokers should be responsible for their cigarette butts and bin when extinguished or a personal ashtray.,,,It upsets my that people don't care where their rubbish ends up.we need to look after our planet and be more responsible with our litter.,,This is a very sad fact that should be more published.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,,this could be true but my smoking addiction would override this,no as i am heavily addicted to smoking,"due to my heavy addiction, this would not be enough to motivate me to quit",,,,this would still not be enough stopping power,i like smoking and this would not be enough to motivate me to stop,,,,,,due to the amount of smokers and cigarettes consumed i believe this statement to be true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,Don't think about these issues when smoking.,,,,"The protection of the environment is very important, so this is discomforting to hear.",,,,,I guess because they are so small its harder to see the impact they have.,,,Hearing about environmental issues is somehow more disheartening to me than health effects.,This is very worrying.,"Need to stop contributing to these problems, seem so avoidable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,Shocked,,,,,pocket ash trays. wow,This happens to where i live too,I did not know that about cigarette filters. Shocked,,I did not know this was happening,,,,,makes me think that is a lot ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,,,Depressing news,It is a sad thought,,Helps reduce guilt of volume of litter,,Not only damaging my health plus children,Councils are already in crisis,,,,,,The scale is overwhelming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,,Donâ€™t believe that is a fact ,Thought it may be more ,Did not realise this fact,,Did not know this,,,,Thatâ€™s scary,,,,,Didnâ€™t think it would be that much ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,,,,,,"Handy! No, I didn't. It's basically a tin, right? Does it have smell-absorbing stuff in it?",,,,I don't really see how they'd measure that?,"Sorry, I've always hated the 'it has hundreds of chemicals!' line of fear, even before I smoked.  It's much stronger to pick a couple of the really revolting ones. ",,,"I'd like you to be more specific about the chemical compounds - it's very easy for the addict brain to go 'pffft, everything is made of chemicals'. ","Yeah, that's gross.",,"Oh man, that is a really long time. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,I don't think it will have a great impact on an addictive behaviour,More needs to be made of the effect on animals,,,,,,,,,More needs to be made of the environmental impact,,,I don't think enough is made of the environmental impact of smoking,It would be great to have clean streets free if cigarette butts,,"Making the health benefits clear helps, especially major things like cancer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,plastic bags surely,,,I think back again and say that most smokers would not deem throwing a butt away could have a detrimental effect on our wildlife ,"I think there are a few other things that take quite a while to degrade as well, doesnt make ANY of it right",,,,,,I  dont think smokers really think of cigarette butts as being environmentally un-friendly. ,,,,"Yes, i agree it is litter and a lot of people just throw them away, regardless of litter fine warnings.",,"I and other smokers know the damage that smoking does, its probably the worlds most addictive drug, it really is a mental condition, because we all know but do very little about it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,,,,,,,This message would make me dispose of the butt in a bin rather than make we want to quit smoking.,,,This message is concerning regarding littering but would not make me stop smoking.,,This message is more appealing than the previous ones but is still more relevant to disposing of the butt rather than quitting smoking.,,This is the most inspiring littering message as it makes you realise how contaminating a single cigarette filter is.,"This message is annoying from a littering point of view, but it is more likely to make me dispose of the butt properly than stop smoking.",,This message inspires me to stop smoking as it relates to my physical health.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,,,,,,,,This is less substantive - I need additional information.,,I don't find this particularly convincing.,This isn't substantive enough - it doesn't detail the impact of these chemicals entering the environment.,,This is slightly more powerful again - I hate the thought of polluting our environment and potentially harming wildlife.,,As previous.,,I think this is pretty powerful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,plastic ? really im pretty sure its from plastic bottles ,,,not something i would do ,,,good idea should be uk wide,,,,"again is that true, sounds a little like scare tactics to me , we all know cigarettes are bad for you but 4500? really ? ",,not sure how believable that is to be honest ,,"whilst an important cause its not enough , i also dont smoke filtered cigarettes so it doesnt apply to me personally ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,"I think this is incorrect , plastic shopping bags and similar materials are more of a problem",,nothing to add for this question,,,,,There are far more serious threats to water supplies such as fracking,,I always attempt to dispose of my cigarette butts in a more thoughtful manner,,,,I dont smoke filter ciagarettes ,I don't know the figures but hard to imagine other forms of litter do not pass this figure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,straws are more common,,,,,,,NONE,,,none,NONE ,,,people litter all the time not just cigarette butts,,it does improve your health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,,,,as previous comment,"It makes me think twice about being a casual litterbug and chucking it out of a car window, but I'm not sure that compared to the impact I could make by cutting down on all sorts of other rubbish / recycling, it's not particularly motivating about stopping smoking full stop",,I think I can wait to get to a bin.,ditto,,'- as before,,,,,"This sounds appalling but I'm not sure I believe it? - maybe in numbers because a cigarette butt is an obvious countable thing, but what about 'paper things' or 'plastic things' which are probably all the same material, just less countable.   A single person giving up would make so little difference that I'm not sure it's a good statistic to motivate people to stop",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,,,i wouldnt believe it,,not sure on this one,,i wouldnt litter my cig butt,,,,that would make me think about what i put in my body,i would probably dispute how true this is,,,if you are enviro conscious it wouldnt make you quit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,,This would only appeal to a limited amount of smokers as it relies on them having care for the enviroment,,,,,,,I do not think many people care about what the cost is to city councils,I could not imagine that many smokers would be motivated to stop with this message,,,,I spoke hand rolled without a filter!,I do not feel this would motivate many people,,I feel this message is very motivative as it shows that you can start to feel the positive of quiting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,,,See  previous answer.,,,This is a good idea as it would hopefully prevent people from throwing cigarette ends on the floor. This idea is not enough for me to consider giving up smoking though.,It would just make me think twice about discarding a cigarette butt on the ground and that's all.,,"I feel slightly guilty about this, but again it doesn't make me want to quit,",I never knew this and it makes me feel slightly guilty but again it wouldn't prevent me from smoking.,,,,,Although that figure is huge it still would encourage me to stop smoking. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,,,"Disposing of cigarette butts on beaches is disgusting, especially when children are playing their",I have to comment that I am guilty of doing this and did not no the fact that you have presented me with.  I will not do this in future.,I enjoy smoking and do not want to cease,,,,,,,Its all about disposing of the cigarettes in the bin and people need to be educated about this,,I appreciate it may harm the environment but I enjoy smoking,People should have the common curtosy to dispose of them in the bin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,,,I dispose of my cigarettes responsibly. If I was going to quit it would be for my health and I wouldnt really consider the environment.,Very sad but again I dispose of my cigarettes responsibly. I dont smoke on the streets or but butts down the drain.,,I wouldnt have a need for one. ,,,,,I am aware of the chemicals in cigarettes. ,,I would be very surprised if this was true but this wouldnt make me want to stop smoking. I dispose of my butts responsibly.,,Environmental issues have no impact on me be able to or wanting to quit smoking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,"doesn't seem to be true art all, surely they are made of paper not plastic",,"i dispose of my ends in a bin so they should end up in landfilll, the message doesn't seem personally relevant to me","doesn't make me want to stop in anyway as i always dispose of my cigarettes in a bin , so it doesn't feel relevant to me personally",,,,,,,,still doesn't feel relevant to me personally as i dispose of them in a bin,,,i don't think this is true. i think there is more plastic waste than cigarette butts,,does make me think about giving up as it explains the benefits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,,,,SURE THEY COULD BE FILTER OUT BEFORE THEY REACH THE SEA.,,A BIT RUBBISH,,,,THIS IS DISTURBING BUT DOESN'T MAKE ME WANT TO QUIT.,"AGAIN, VERY DISTURBING BUT THERE ARE CHEMICALS RELEASED BY OTHER PRODUCTS THAT ALSO CAUSE DAMAGE. ",,LINKING TO THE ENVIROMENT ISN'T THE ANSWER.,,AGAIN LINKED TO THE ENVIROMENT.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,,,possibly,,"There are many different types of filter,some of which are biodegradable",,,Utter rubbish,,,,,utter drivel,,possibly,,I believe these statistics to be false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,,"Again, nothing I haven't heard before. ",,,,,I'm not in Bristol nor do I litter. ,,,"Again - I don't litter, not my problem. I dispose of mine correctly. ",I've read every horrific fact and truth about smoking there is - nothing will change my mind. ,I don't litter. ,,,I don't litter the butts so not my problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,,,,,would not motivate me at all,,,"this would not motivate me at all , these messages are useless speaking from a smokers point of view we feel bad enough about being addicted surely to stop a smoker you shouldnt make them feel bad as your likely to be motivated by counciling etc",,,,again my addiction would out weigh this and its very hard to admit this and im not very proud about itbut no it would not sway me,again this would not sway me in anyway sadly addiction would win,as a smoker this would not motivate me at all even though i am very enviromentally savvy its simply down too addiction my adddiction would this over and over.,,,as an addict this slightly motivates me but again addiction would win,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,Cigarette butts arenâ€™t made from plastic though ,,,,,,So thereâ€™s people committing serious offences but they are out to get Susan who chucks a small bit of paper on the floor,"Doubt it, it will probably help clean the water as the clue is in the name â€œfilterâ€",,,,Never heard of it,,It will probably help filter the water,,,I can believe this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,I donâ€™t think this is a good deterrent ,I donâ€™t think this is an effective message,,"Whilst this is sad, I feel that if you are responsible and dispose of them correctly, this wonâ€™t happen.",,,,"Whilst it is negative, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s an effective way to stop people smoking.",,,,,,I donâ€™t think this is a good message to try and deter people.,,,A good reason to stop smoking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,,,,,I donâ€™t see how me stopping would help solve that ,,I would make sure I am disposing if my cigarettes in the bin and not on the floor ,Still not enough to stop me but would worry me that it could pose a threat to human health ,Maybe stop people disposing them on the floor but not to quit ,,,,Again not something I worry about personally ,The environment is not something that would stop me smoking ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,plastic water bottles are also bad,,,,,,just scares me to drop the butt ,,this is bas cause the moenby cojld be spent on educaion or something mpre importsnt ,,,this actually makes me really sad ,"not sure what else to say here, sorry  ",it is a scary fact  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,"I always use an ashtray, though i agree this is an issue",,,,This can be an issue,,,"I suppose it could, but water is filtered before reaching households",,Butts are an unsightly thing to see i admit,,I don't want wildlife to dieD:,,"Unless i see this in action, i wouldn't think much of it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,,,,It makes me want to manage my/other smokers waste better.,"I'm sure some will be swayed, perhaps i am stubborn",I had no idea they existed and would absolutely have used one had I known.,,,,Again it makes me want us to manage waste better. smokers will smoke regardless,It isn't going to stop the majority of smokers from smoking.,,,It just makes me want to make sure filters do not wind up in sources of water,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,,,,,I smoke rollups without a filter ,I have never ever heard of a personal ashtray before ,"It doesn't motivate me to want to quit, but it would make me be more cautious on what I do with the cigarette when I've finished with it. ",Literally everything on this planet is hazardous to our health these days apparently. ,You could look at it on the flip side and say it's creating a job? I think I've seen more normal litter and gum on the floor that cigarettes ,,,,,Look at the food/waste industry dumping all sorts into water...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,"Again, this only makes me feel like I should be more considerate of how I dispose of butts, either that or switch to roaches.","The use of the word ""toxins"" instantly switches me off even listening to the message. I only associate this word with pseudoscience.",,,,,,,,,,Same as before - too vague. It comes across as patronising.,This just makes me want to be more responsible with butt disposal rather than think of quitting.,"It is far too wordy. The use of the words ""chemical substances"" sounds too vague and anti- science. ",,,I like the positive spin on this. It is encouraging rather than guilt tripping.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,,,"Although I do want to quit, I don't personally litter so this doesn't motivate me","Again, I don't dispose of filters like this so I don't feel like I'm responsible for this. It's a good thing to know though, thanks!",,,I always use bins because of this. ,,"Again, I don't personally litter so this alone doesn't motivate me",,,I had no idea. This is definitely motivating in general ,,That is insane. Cigarette litter is a bigger problem than I realised.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,,I find this statement more motivating than the last as it's a bit more detailed.,,It could concentrate more on the health of individuals rather than fish etc.,Mentions no health benefits,,,,,Not as appealing as some of the other messages as it doesn't provide any encouragement in terms of health benefits,,,,Shows a very serious problem,,,Gives you encouragement and motivation to quit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,,,,,,,I don't live in Bristol so it's irrelevant ,Nothing,,Nothing,,I didn't know this ,,That is serious and I didn't know this ,,,It makes it seems as though its never too late to stop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,,,,It is very bad that that happens to animals,Cigarettes shouldn't be dropped. ,,"I wouldn't drop it anyway, so it wouldn't encourage me to give up",This is also true of lots of things,,,I wasn't aware of this,,,I make sure I dispose of them properly ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,,,,,"This is not nice to read, I am not only dmamahjng myself but the environment as well",,This specific information doesnâ€™t motivate me to quit because I donâ€™t tend to drop mine on the floor. I generally use the ashtray on top of bins ,,I imagine it would take many more man hours to clean the waste from the streets than smokers actually realise. ,,"I know that smoking is unhealthy, but when you see messages/facts about chemicals and I think about what I am doing to body it makes me want to quit. This is happening all of time now. ",,,This message does make me want to quit ,,,This scares me ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,,This makes me consider the harm cigarettes cause to me,,I have done this and did not realise the impact on the environment.,,"I have not heard of a ashtray that fits in the pocket. I would not use these, I would rather use a bin.","I would not drop my cigarette butts on the floor anyway, regardless of the fine.",,,,,,The message reminds me of the impact smoking has on the environment. ,This makes me think of the harm cigarettes cause to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,I didn't think cigarettes contain plastic,,Im guessing as it's difficult to know if this is factually correct,,,I was not aware of this.  It seems a bit strange if it's true,,,,This seems beleivable ,,There are lots of chemicals in cigarettes.  No doubt some are harmful to nature,,It seems beleivable considering the amount of chemicals in cigarettes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,Are they really? ,,,Again selfishly I have only ever thought about the damage it caused myself through smoking not of others. I can say it has been on my mind to quit as of late and this is helping to seal the fate on that decision.,I did know this and have recently been reaching instead of using filters as much.,,,,,,,Again this is a fact that iv never sat and pondered. Wide scale advertising of facts like these to allow people to be more aware.,True but smokers can not be the only to blame why is it legal to still be allowed to produce plastic substances. I roll my own cigarettes so can do that without using any plastic. Smoking is possible without plastic pollution ,This is not something that I had ever thought about previously ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,,its shocking and i will definately rethink using filters in my roll up cigarettes,thats a disgusting statistic to hear but i also think it says a lot about how irresponible some people can be at properly disposing,,,i didnt know this but it wouldnt put me off as such ,,,,,its a scary statitic and very upsetting to think,,,I actually didnt know this and its quite horrifying,,,this is the usual message and it really is a drastic message but i think due to the addiction and because it isnt something i can see i tend to avoid thinking about it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,Wow!! I though plastic bags would be the culprit here,,I figured that would be the case,,,Awesome idea but doesn't make me want to quit,,,,,Not really specific enough,Wow. I did not know that,We owe it to the environment to quit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,That's terrible ,,,,,Doesn't motivate me to quit at all I dont like the sou9of it t wouldnt want the smell in my pocket. ,,,Councils waste enough money although austerity has hit them hard,I always use an ashtray I can't bear littering I think it's inexcusable ,,I didn't realise the effects to the environment were as stark as that ,I care about the environment and this is sad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,No comment. ,"This and most likely the other messages in this study are my motivation for quitting, I have had thousands of cigarettes in my lifetime and I'm 24, not had one for 3 days and its going great. ",,,,"Not a motivator to quit, and not something I would do if still smoked, plenty bins around. ",O_O ouch. ,,,,,Definitely a motivator. ,None of those are mine!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,,,,The health and well being of animals is very important to me so this is motivating ,,I did not know this however it doesnt even make me think about not smoking. ,,,This is obviously unfair for people who dont smoke,,This motivates me as I value looking after the environment ,The health of the environment overall and the health and well being of animals is very important to me so this is motivating. ,Ocean pollution and the overall health of the ocean is something thats important to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,none,,,furher info/evidence to be shared,none,this is not a well known fact.this should be advertised,,,none,,,,"further info on how they end up there, would be beneficial",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,,,"This is motivating, no one wants to be responsible for that happening ",,,,I would just put it in the bin ,,,,I am already aware of this but seeing it reminds me that I've  got to stop ,This would stop me from throwing cigarettes on the floor ,This has more impact on the rest of society. I do this sometimes so this would make me think about it ,,,,This is motivating as this is why most  want to stop ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,,Similar to the last message.  Even though I do not discard butts discriminately it is a good message to get out there considering the dangers our marine life face.,,,,,,,"My council charges up to Â£100 for dropping anything in the street, so this is not so much of a motivation.",,Very motivating to see the amount of chemicals ad how these can affect the greater environment.,"I am a wildlife lover, so this message is particularly pertinent.","It is an important message given the state of our oceans but personally I never do this, I always place butts back in the packet after stubbing them out.",,,,12 weeks!  I did not know this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,,,This makes me feel bad and embarrassed ,,I didnâ€™t know this. Does make me stop and think ,I didnâ€™t know this information ,,,,Again makes me embarrassed ,,This would not make me give up although would make me stop and think for abit about what I am doing.,This would not make me give up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,,again doesn't effect me wanting to smoke but motivates me thinking about how to dispose of cigarettes,cigarette smokers need to dispose of butts carefully,it doesn't make me want to stop smoking but does make me realise that throwing cigarettes down drains is damaging,I think after reading this it make me wonder why cigarette manufacturers are not being held responsible,,,makes me think about how I discard my cigarettes,,,,makes me want to dispose of cigarette butts carefully,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,,I think itâ€™s very true like beside other things like plastic,"True,Iâ€™ve seen loads of butts on the beach",Sad to hear this is why we should use a bin,,,"Yes,brilliant message,I smoke but hate to see ciggarette butts on the streets",,Iâ€™m pretty sure that the council pays their employee to clean the streets and I find plastic to be much more of a problem,,,Never hear of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,,,,,,,so people who drop them should be fined,1,i also believe this to be true,people do dispose of cigarettes wrongly,,yes i believe that to be true,,,,,totally agree,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,,,"This is repulsive, I remember during the summer last year seeing a huge amount of rubbish, including cigarette ends, left on my local beach and it was a horrible sight. Especially with young children playing just a few feet away. This has also made me think a lot more.","I was unaware of the impact this has on wildlife and environmental factors. Putting a cigarette down the drain often made me feel like I was in fact being more responsible in disposing of it, however I understand now how this may not be the case.",,,,,"This is less surprising, but certainly something I had not be consciously aware of. I always try to dispose of cigarettes in bins however when the opportunity presents itself. Annoyingly however the frequency of public waste bins can make this difficult sometimes.",,I am shocked to hear that so many chemicals are present in such a small item. This is motivation to more carefully consider my actions when disposing of cigarette ends.,This is disturbing and upsetting news to me. As mentioned before I was ignorant to this thought and this has made me consider my actions.,,,,,As a first time father I am conscious about my health and well-being; reading this only strengthens my goal of quitting smoking for good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,,all wild life is important.,i personally throw my cigarettes in the bin and never on the floor so it feels good knowing that i am not a part of it,i kind of would like to quit smoking because i like all sort of wild life and if anyone kills an animal i always think of it as murder i personally don't flick cigarette down the drain so it does not affect me to much.,plastic is bad and in the environment this is even worse as animals might teat it but knowing that it degrades is good,,,,we pay tax for things like the nhs and not for councils to pick up our waste.,,like i said in the previous question all wild life is important so we should not ruin it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,,This again is very worrying ,,This is worrying ,I did not know this ,,,,I agree with this and I dispose of cigarette butts in the correct way ,It definitely motivates me to clean up more,No comment ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,,,Itâ€™s bad as a stat but doesnt really surprise me or make me want to change my behaviour ,It makes you think about the deeper consequences of a small action,,,Presumptuous and sanctimonious - people donâ€™t like being told what to do,,So do other firms of litter like chewing gum or fly tipping - people expect councils to clean their cities ,,This ones a bit tired - more effective ways of saying this ,,,,,,"I like this, itâ€™s positive in its message unlike many other smoking messages ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,i know they take a long time to degrade but again this does not motivate me into quitting,,,,,,i expect there to be a fine for littering but its not motivational for me to consider quitting,im not sure this statement is a fact and does not motivate me into quitting,this statement does not motivate me in any way,,this motivates me a little but not enough to give me a push into wanting to quit,,,,,,this motivates me somewhat as its to do with my health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"This doesn't make me want to quit or even consider it remotely. The only thing this makes me think is ""oh I didn't know they were plastic""",,"I don't go anywhere near a beach, ever so I don't see this and it does not effect me (that I can see, or instantly)","This does make me want to quit a tiny amount because I do car about animals, but yet again - ""out of sight; out of mind""",,"I am confused why this one would motivate me to quit, when it's promoting it kind of.. it's suggesting to carry an ashtray with me. Unless I am missing something from this and really it's trying to hint at something else?",,,"The fact I am having to pay extra to clean it up - even though I actually use the ashtrays on bins provided, a lot do not. So it is frustrating. SO this does want me to stop a little but not an overwhelming amount.",,"Again, this is nothing that I can see so it's ""out of sight, out of mind"" basically.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,,,,Donâ€™t want to quit ,I donâ€™t want to quit ,,I donâ€™t really smoke when Iâ€™m out ,Same as before,Donâ€™t want to quit ,Donâ€™t want to quit ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,,I care about fish,,,Environment is important ,It dosent make me want. To quit,I don't live in Bristol ,Human health is important ,,Rubbish is rubbish ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,,"It's selfish but this wouldn't be the biggest motivator to quit smoking, many other disposable products also contaminate water and damage the environment",It's a bit of a vague percentage and as mentioned previously I always dispose of cigarette ends properly,,,,It doesn't motivate me at all to want to quit because I always use a bin,"It's a bit noncommittal, 'could' and 'may' are a bit vague. ",,"It's disgusting but still doesn't motivate me to want to quit, I always dispose of cigarette butts by extinguishing and putting in a bin",,,,,,,"That's quite powerful, especially as I currently have a cold which is on my chest and I know smoking exasperates the situation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"I am already aware that it has a negative environmental impact but generally do not think about that when I crave a cigarette when I am trying to quit, or when I have given up smoking previously.",,,Another strong motivator as media about plastic waste impacting sea life is prevalent nowadays,Again I know that they are not good for me or the environment but is not at the forefront of my mind when considering whether to continue to smoke.,"I am not sure if this question is if I know I can get a free personal ashtray, or if the question is whether it motivates me to quit. It does not motivate me to quit but would make it easier when I cannot find an ashtray outdoors, and I would feel less guilty about littering.",,Now that I think about it affecting drinking water it is a stronger motivator than telling me what it costs the council to clean up off the streets.,Whilst I feel guilty if I do drop a cigarette (rarely) I also see lots of other litter that needs cleaning up. It is not a motivator to quit on its own,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,"As with before. things like this don't really incentivise me. While I certainly do what I can to minimise my use of plastics, it's up to the corporations to use alternative products (such as hemp etc) rather than try to make me feel guilty for using the very products they make.",,,"I don't flick my cigarettes down drains, and wouldn't do so. The message is certainly a helpful one for anyone who is unaware but wouldn't, imo, lead to anyone quitting smoking itself.","It is unclear to me why such messages would want anyone to quit smoking. At best, it would make me desire and look for a decent method with which to dispose of cigarette filters. ",,,Corporations pump all manner of toxins and 'threats to human health' into water and contaminate the food chain and yet it is the individual trying to get some personal enjoyment from a product he likes being made to feel guilty that his enjoyment might pose the most minimal negative impact imaginable to other human beings.,"I pay my taxes. If I had the ability to use my taxes in certain areas, I'd happily provide some for waste clean up rather than on the military or something like that. This does nothing for me, sorry.

These messages don't really hold much sway with me, for I have always been aware of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,this is a great way to show people how smoking effects your health,,,,,,,,,shows people just how expensive smoking is ,,,great initiative to stop,great message to show people that the damage can be somewhat reversed,,,,,,,,,,,,,I agree that is a very positive way to look at the situation,,,,,,,,,yes I agree with this,,,,
102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I have actually quit smoking before I used an ecig I worked in a vape shop as a manager I helped 1000's of people stop smoking. my stress levels have always been the same regardless of smoking or not,I aren't worried about gaining weight as I am active in my job role and would snack on fruit and veg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I feel this is correct keeping the mind active is the key,,,,help is certainly needed when quitting smoking but 95% is willpower and the want to do it. no scare tactics will working on the current smokers in the country. the packets are seen by many as a deterrent but in actual fact smokers look at the packets and have discussions about them. current smokers don't care about the scare tactics. ,,,I feel as though the association of smoking and a routine is correct I have a coffee and a cigarette on a morning and I also have a cigarette after meal time I feel that a replacement would combat the urge to have one.,,,,,,I feel that no plan is needed for stopping smoking at all plans change issues arise life is difficult for everyone as it is let alone beating yourself up over having a lapse. writing a plan out will always fail certain situations will affect the plans made. I always used to tell my customers to start there journey quitting smoking by having a cigarette in a morning one at lunch and after there evening meals. the temptation is too strong for certain people. slowly cut out the lunchtime one and continue cutting down.,,,
103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My appearance is important to me.,,,,The guilt that it affects loved ones is the single biggest motivator to quit.,,,,,,,,I would like to be better at physical activity.,,,,,,,,,,,,It would be too daunting.,Its helpful if I do quite yet it is not motivation alone to quit.,If they are a similar alternative then I would switch but there is no guarantee in this statement.,,,,,,
104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,i dont feel the pains of these so as with the first statement its detached ,,,,,,,,"can add, still get hit by a bus, its too easy to disregard and far too many factors to take as a statment",,because its just facts and basic information it feels detached from me caring,same as before history of heart issues in family connects me to this statment ,family has a history of heart failure so hit a cord ,,,,,,,,,,,,provideds a way to ease the cravings but in some circles vaping is looked down upon ,,,,,

116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It motivates me as it states the advantages of smoking and how the heart is extremely important.  It could be a little better if it gave examples of what to do instead of smoking/ alternatives.,,This is really helpful as it gives other options to help to reduce cravings and stress.  It tells you how to reduce this and going for a walk is a simple thing that can help which is done everyday.,,,"This is good as it gives a message to people that stopping to smoke is possible but it's not motivating to do so, for example, giving consequences of smoke, for them to see how bad it actually is.

Also concerned that not enough time has lapsed between research and the harm they may cause,,,,,The hardest to give up is after a meal. Also social smoking with friends who smoke,,,,,,,All of the above are good reasons for giving up smoking.  Also as we get older it becomes harder but more important to quit,,
121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Very good to no this i have tried maybe being told more positve things wud encourge to help stop,,,It does make me want to quit seeing this message ,,,,,,,I would feel so much better in myself also ,,Also makes me want to quit ,Exersie is also good so wud get me to start exercising ,,,,,,,,,,They are less harmfull but more expensive in my opion,,,,,,

125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,These figures are quite startling.,,,,This sounds as if it would be achievable with a little effort.,,,,,This is a lot of money. It adds up quickly.,,,,,,I don't have children so these figures have no effect on me. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,There is quite a range of different products now which can only improve the chances of quitting.,,,,,,,Support would be useful as long as you didn't feel 'watched' all the time.,,,,

I'd imagine quitting smoking might slightly improve my chances and will attempt to before we try again,,,,,,,"As I previously stated I've been thinking of quitting, and would love to see my health improve",,,,,,,,,,,Smoking can be just a habit rather than a full on addiction to some people so this could be really helpful to many people,,,,,,,I have massively decreased the amount of cigarettes I smoke because of all the reasons above. Every smoker should at least attempt quitting for if not one or more of these reasons,"If people genuinely wanted to quit then they have no excuse to give this a go, with it being cheaper or even free",
127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I believe that this is quite accurate ,,Not sure about these figures ,Again I'm not sure about these figures ,,,,,,,,,,It's a very true statement.  Having tried myself to quit smoking on many occasions ,I have had a certain amount of success with patches,,,,,,,,,,,I believe this is true,
128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Actually, that scares me as an older smoker - the fact that only after 10 years my risk of lung cancer falls to half that of a smoker.",6 weeks sounds like a reasonable amount of time to feel an obvious result.

129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"On face value, it doesn't seem possible. If smoking is so bad for me in the long term, why is my risk of heart disease going to drop so quickly? Does this mean I can smoke through my youth and then quit as I start reaching middle-age?",,,,"Personally, when I read studies show I get a wave of doubt. After all, this is the same argument used by people who are against vaccinations. I would prefer concrete proof as the stress relief is a reason for my smoking, and there is a stressful period involved in quitting smoking that is completely avoided in the message.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I am constantly hearing mixed messages about e-cigarettes, and I find e-cigs are only useful at home. For me personally, the smell of a real cigarette is what can cause cravings to start when I'm quitting, and I'd still have to smoke with other smokers due to the policies in many establishments regarding e-cigs ",,,,"useful advice, but easily abused advice. As someone has has repeatedly tried to quit smoking, any excuse is a good excuse. ""Oh no, I'm within a mile of a shop that sells cigarettes. Today just isn't suitable.""as a hyperbolic example",,,,,,"Personally this means nothing to me, there's only so much people can do and it's a very personal challenge to undertake. This message is more useless to introverted people.",,"If that message is aimed at people actively looking to quit smoking, it is effective. However for those not, the message is quite nonplussed. It more subtly suggests negative impacts of smoking, but I believe the message is far too subtle for someone who has no plans to quit smoking",,
130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,good message aiming at preventing lung cancer,would have more energy,,,,Most people smoke on their own,,,,would help prevent heart attack,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,would be free on the NHS and you would have support,,,not easy,,,,,,,,,
131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I only smoke about a pack a week sometimes less, so this saving message does not overly motivate me to give up. ",,,"I only smoke in the pub garden, so this does not apt to me. ",,,,,,,,Health messages like this are much more motivational for me. Especially these more positive 'it's not too late' messages. I suffer from mild asthma too so this adds to the motivation. ,,,,,Tempted to go back and try e cigarettes but I used them alot more than actual smoking! ,,,,,,"I only smoke when I have a drink at the pub, so this would not motivate me as I'm not giving up that! ðŸ˜‚",,It's more the social aspect that I enjoy abd I really don't like chewing gum! Disgusting habit! ,,,,,,,
132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,If I was planning on stopping this would make me feel positive and reiterate that I made the correct decision.,,,,I like to think I am not vain but this is a definite incentive to stop.,,Saving money is definitely an incentive for me but I smoke roll ups which are much cheaper and cost me approximately Â£50 per month. It's a good message but not appropriate to me.,Again I don't have issues and so whilst a positive message this doesn't affect me so I don't feel that it would help me to quit smoking.,,,,,,,,,,,This is not something you consider in your 30s and 40s if you don't experience cardiac problems which I don't. Although I never know when that may change. At which point my view will change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Again the message is not for me as I don't plan to give up but I like having a plan if I did. It's gives me goals and writing it down makes it clearer and also a good reminder.,,,
133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Slightly more motivating but what gets me are the number of people who contract lung cancers who have never smoked.,,,,,,,,Don't believe this one at all.,,,,,,I have no doubts that it's true but offset my smoking habit with daily cardio vascular exercise and stick my head in the sand so to speak.,,Don't believe that it can be quantified in this manner to be honest.,,,,I have no problems at this time exercising.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes the best route to take to quit without a doubt.
134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,An extra Â£264 a month is extremely motivational,,,,This is very motivational as I would like to have kids. If quitting smoking increases my chances then I would do it,,,,,,,,"This statement motivates me to quit smoking, and regaining full lung capacity",,,,,"E-cigarettes seem like a good alternative, healthier, cheaper, better tasting and no smell",,,,,,Hearing this would positively impact me to quit smoking,Knowing that I have other options than just cold turkey is very motivational. I know I wouldn't be left to deal with it on my own.,,,,,,,
135,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I don't believe this statement.,,,,,,,,,,I don't have children so this is no motivation for me and i only smoke at home so i am not affecting anybody else.,,,,I don't fully believe that is true and also we could die at any time so this doesn't really motivate me to stop.,,,This motivates me slightly but it's hard to appreciate at this moment the affect smoking has on my heart.,,,,,,,,It would take a lot of will power even so even if the day is not a stressful one etc,,,,,,,,,This motivates me slightly but it will still be hard to stop smoking.,
136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This message is great as it highlights the health improvements in just 12 weeks! A short time span which could inspire people to get started on quitting,,,,,,"This advice may appeal to some, but for me it wouldn't be a factor in me deciding to quit. ",,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a strong message. For people that may feel they have smoked too long for giving up to make any difference, it could motivate them to give it a go!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This message is good as it voices others who have been in this position, so the quitter can relate to something ",,,A very supportive tone,,,,,"I like this message as it's encouraging an alternative, which personally would want, rather than going full on cold turkey!"
137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"12 weeks isn't a very long time, so that's a positive fact to hear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I get very out of breath, very easily. To know it could ease within 3 weeks makes me feel better.",,"One year is a short time, and a good time to improve the heart.",,"I found that using my hands for other things like colouring, reduces my smoking.",,,,,,,,It's good to know that it wouldn't stay as hard forever.,,,I'm very likely to do this before quitting completely.,,,,,

140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It does make you think deep after reading this however, itâ€™s not enough",,,,,,"An addiction is an addiction, people care about how much is being spent on pleasurable habits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This statement sounds a bit more encouraging,,Not really sure what to say about this one. Iâ€™m a bit left sided,,,,,,,,,"As helpful as the statement may sound, it just isnâ€™t enough for someone who canâ€™t go a couple hours without smoking to try quitting.",,
141,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Economic climate is lowering morale, so this is fairly inspiring ",Itâ€™s just interesting,,,Itâ€™s very long winded time wise ,I worry about my future having children ,,Morbid but true,,,,,,,,,I do vape a fair bit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
142,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This does motivate me to want to quit but not enough ,,,,,I have tried to quit smoking and all I did was eat to replace the cigarette cravings my activity wasnâ€™t as good as I felt low from not having any nicotine so I donâ€™t think the best advice is keep fit and eat healthy thereâ€™s more to it than that ,,,,,,I agree with this I quit smoking when I was pregnant as I knew it would increase health problems ,,,,,With a history of lung cancer in the family this really motivates me ,,,,,,,,I do find e cigarettes good but there is also negative points on not full evidence that they are safe to use and many true stories of e cigs catching fire ,,,,,,,,,The vape pens are really good I use this as a sub to help quitting ,,,,,,
143,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lung cancer scares me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Interested in when coughing stops,,Concerned about strokes,I tend to smoke whilst out walking ,,,,,,,,,,I enjoyed vapimg but lapsed,,,,I have had some serious health thoughts recently and am starting to worry about the side effects ,,
144,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I was brought up in a second hand smoke environment, I put that down as the reason I started smoking ",,,,Without seeing evidence I would take this info with a pinch of salt ,,,"Smoking is only a small part of a bigger problem when it comes to life expectancy, to many warnings like this would probably make me smoke",,,,,,This would be helpful if there wasn't so 'evidence' against it funded by tobacco companies ,,Would this message be with additional information about the types of ways that can help? If so it would be fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lots of my friends vape now instead of smoke and are alot healthier 
145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I have started going to gym more often and feel that smoking is preventing me achieving goals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This is something I really want to achieve.,,Although the health warnings on packets are easy to ignore I often find myself thinking of the health implications.,,,,,,,,I agree.

147,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nobody ever knows whats around the corner,It makes me want to re evaluate my smoking habits.,,A good motivational message ,,,,,,"When put like that, it is a good motivation to stop.",,,,This is already an issue i have due to other health problems ,,,,,A good reason for people to stop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It's a powerful way to get over the fact that your smoking effects others and will encourage you to quit ,,,The message is a pull on the heart strings all parents want their kids to be healthy,,,,,,,,,,,,,It's good to know the outcomes,,,,,,,This is a positive message it shows capes can help you quit smoking,I believe the only person who can help you quit is yourself,This message does not appeal to me ,,,
149,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,If money was enough motivation I'd have stopped long ago.,As previous,Shoes benefit within a short period of time so encouraging.,,,,,,,An encouragement ,,,,,,,,I think it's too soon to be making health claims about e-cigs.,Sounds a bit condescending.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Great for health,,,,,,,Look at what others go through when you smoke,,,,,,,,,,,,,Helps to know the damage isn't permanent ,,,,,,I feel better about these,,,,,,Perseverance is keu,,There are other options ,,,,,,
155,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I've got problems with stress and anxiety so this seems a nice positive thought, & I imagine it would be for pay much anyone no matter how relaxed they are already! It's a change from the usual stop smoking messages as well which is good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I forget about how easy the Champix makes it so a reminder doesn't go amiss, and I think the statistic is helpful cos nobody wants to even try to stop if all the messages you get are going on about how hard it is (which I find they tend to be), better to have some confidence","As with the first line, NRT doesn't do it for me but I think the positive statistics are the right step as I said in my last answer, to give people a boost to begin","Just seems a bit obvious, maybe a little patronising...I doubt many people choose to try to quit on their most stressful day, surrounded by fags and other smokers!",,,,,,,,"Another one that is just common sense really - it's the sort of thing you think about but never actually do though, so a bit more helpful than the last one I think","I've tried NRT before and it didn't really help me so this message doesn't appeal to me personally; I think it would be good for some people though, particularly if they don't know they can get it free",

157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Making people more aware that smoking ages them by this much such be publicised more.,,,,,This is important as it makes people more aware of the risks and benefits to smoking,,It just shows the importance of quitting,I wouldn't believe that it would be this much,,,,,,This is very important as it shows them that they will be much healthier and the drastic improvements that it will have if they stop.,,,,,,,Gum and patches help people stop smoking and more people need to be aware of this.,,,,,,,,,,,
158,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My weight has always been good ,,,,,,I have a big family ,,Really good to know,,,,Again great to get this info,,,Always good to know the fact ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Iâ€™m always happy to save money ,
159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,As before,,,,,,,,,,As before,,,,,Positive messages like this do make me think more about giving up.  ,,,,,,,,I would find this advice helpful and would prefer to replace my smoking with positive things and not medication or other addictions,,,,,,,,,I do not agree with doctors prescribing anti depressants as smoking cessation aids.  I have had a very bad experience when I was prescribed these.  I was not deprssed so whilst the urge to smoke did disappear it effected my mental health badly.  Its a no brainer that you shouldnt prescribe anti depressants to people who are not depressed!!  I also dont agree with replacing one addiction with another. ,,,,,,,I think the vape contraptions look ridiculous and I dont think they have been in circulation or had enough testing over a long period of time to claim they are less harmful.
160,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Good health info to try and encourage you,,It's a good message to try and encourage you,,It's good info to have to try and encourage you,,,,,,,,It's good info that I never really thought of,,,,,,,,,,,Again it's good as it lets you know about the health benefits,,,,,,,It's good advice but it's hard to tell if you will have a stressful day,,,,,,,,,,
161,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I think it will get used for home improvements.,This is an interesting fact that I did not know previously.,,,,"This makes me feel guilty as my daughter has asthma and I always wonder if it is my fault,",This motivates me to quit as I think about being around for my daughter as long as I can.,,,,,,,This is something that stops and makes me think as it isn't one of the first things that springs to mind when I think of the reasons for quitting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I have used them in the past but am not convinced by the research, I am sure that ecigs are not completely safe."
162,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Knew this ,,,,,,,,,,,Didnâ€™t know that ,,Very motivating and interesting ,,,,,,Doesnâ€™t tell me anything I donâ€™t already know really ,,,,,,I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d Finsbury it hard to quit ,,Didnâ€™t know they gave advice at the shop ,,,,,,
163,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Not all diseases are smoking related. ,,,,I am not usually stressed,,,My skin will still age even if i stop smoking .,It would be nice to have that much money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It is hard to break habits.,,,,I do not like e ciggerettes,,,,,
164,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10 years of not smoking sounds too long and makes me wonder if I could do it,,,,,"I donâ€™t agree with this, as when Iâ€™ve quit in the past Iâ€™ve become easily stressed and frustrated ",,,Everyone wants to look their best,,,,,,,,,It just seems so long to see the big benefits of not smoking,,This motivates me because an extra 10 years of life is definitely worth at least trying to quit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I have heard about people getting addicted to the nicotine replacements and then returning to smoking ,,,,,,,
165,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This would obviously motivate me since having clean lungs would make me less worry.,,,,"This I do agree with because having too much to smoke can have your ability to u change the way you taste and smell, because this has happen to me a few times.","While I do agree with the message above that stress usually goes down when quitting smoking, but I feel like i'm in the middle of this because it depends on the type of person who can be able to handle less stress if they quit smoking or they need smoking to handle it.","To me, gaining weight when stop smoking wouldn't worry me because I am one of those type of people who are more worried about losing weight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While this message is helpful to others, I feel like patches don't really help me compared to other methods.",,,,,,,,,,,I 100% agree with this since i've started using e-cigarettes and they have helped a lot.
166,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,seeing this having a small child makes me want to quit more so...,,,,watch the family grow old and use the money for the better,,,,,,,,you have got to be in the right frame of mind to do it,I think they can be a really great help if you want to do it.,,you cannot predict how a day is going to run no matter how much u prepare and plan,,,,,,When quitting you need all the help you can get.,,,,
167,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In my personal opinion, we are all going to die of something eventually so this wouldnâ€™t really motivate me into quitting.",,,,,Most of the people around me smoke too so this really wouldnâ€™t motivate me to want to quit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,When I hear â€œe-cigarettesâ€ I automatically think â€œVapesâ€ which I personally donâ€™t think are very safe.,,,,,,"A cigarette at work is an excise for a break, if I donâ€™t need a cigarette I wonâ€™t get a break.",,I feel a more personal approach would appeal to me better.,,,"Iâ€™ve tried to quit before and Iâ€™ve felt bad asking others to not smoke near me, this message would make me feel more at ease about speaking with other smokers and asking them to smoke outside when visiting my house.",,,,
168,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,sounds good that only after 5 days nicotine is nearly out your body ,,,i would put on weight because i would eat more insteead of smoke ,,,,,,,,its nice to know you have less chance of stroke or hert attack ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,most days are stressfull and most people i know smoke ,,,,,i dont like the thought of e cigarettes ,,,,,i dont beilieve they are as safe as people say 
169,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I don't smoke a pack a day (smoke 6-7 rollies) so irrelevant ,,,I already have 4 children!!!!,,,,,,,,I like knowing that a difference can be made in a short space of time,"One year is long, and halved doesn't sound great. You could better word this as ""You are twice as likely to have a heart attack if you keep smoking than if you stop today"" or similar ",,,"I hate e cigarettes, it's just getting addicted to something else, can't see the point even if it's less harmful. I really disagree with them ",,,,Useful statistic but if the government REALLY wanted to help they should make tobacco companies fund them ,,,,,,,,,,,
170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unsure if this is a valid reason that would stop someone quitting sounds more like an excuse but nice to know that research shows you don't,,,,,,,,,,,Straight talking in forces the health benefits of quitting and is backed by research,,,,,,,,,,,Encourages you to take the first step and informs you of the various options available,,,,,,,,,Clear information explains what you should do should you plan to quit also tells u about options available,Unsure how this would help with motivation,Promotes the financial benefit of quitting as well as an available quitting option,
171,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,As someone with heart issues that is a scary statistic that I don't disagree with. ,,,"I agree, smoking does cause lots of problems. Even after not smoking for a week my lungs feel better. ",,,,,,,,,,Releasing endorfins through exercise has a large positive impact on your mood. ,,,,"I've never tried them. My friend has and it didn't work for him, however I don't think he truly wants to quit yet. ","It all depends on the person, if they truly want to quit they will. However if deep down they still need it they will be less effective. ",,,,,"Vape is almost harmless on the lungs, however it just doesn't have the same effect as a good smoke. ",,,,,,
172,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10 years seems like a huge amount of time for only half the risk. Smoking is something I still find enjoyable due to social factors.,,,,I was actually unaware that nicotine reduces my ability to taste and smell. This also makes me less likely to switch to alternatives to smoking such as e-cigarettes. ,,,,,,,,,,,,"Six hours per day is a huge amount of time resulting in almost 2 days extra lifespan for each week I quit, very convincing to quit.",,,,A well known fact and very convincing. ,,,"The lack of actual values in the statement makes it seem less provoking. I cut my risk sure, but by how much? 1%? Not as convincing then. Still as it happens immediately it would be worth stopping.",,,,,,,,,The first weeks are obviously the hardest and is the reason so many people are unable to stop smoking. I know if I made it past these weeks it would be much easier but it makes it a lot harder to partake in any activities during these first couple of weeks due to the cravings.,,,,,,,,
173,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,See this makes me want to quit as I love to eat and I knOw smoking effects your tatses,I'm not sure if this is the case as I have friends who need to chew gum or have a fidget spinner to take their minds of things ,,,,,Save up for a deposit for a new home,It makes me want to quit but the feeling to smoke is much more stronger,,,,,,I feel this message would motivate a lot of people who are wanting to quit,,Spend time with family and friends and maybe do things I've always wanted to do such as learn to swim ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,i feel that the excessive consumption of cigarettes ages your skin especially if starting at a young age,"i feel the money i save spending on packets would just be spent on something else therefore i wont be saving any money, would most likely be spent on alcohol",feel this money would be used on another habit which people will frown upon such as alcohol consumption,,,im currently not in a relationship and see no children in my future,,,,,,,,,,,,,feel that i should be able to use this product in public places and not be near smokers outside,,,,,i feel that this will be replaced with a different type of habit which wont be any help to me,,,,,,,,,
175,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Another strong positive message that is without judgement - these are much more motivating and hopeful,,,I like the first sentence - but the second sentence sets up for failure...if someone doesn't feel more relaxed once they've quit they will feel doubly awful.,,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a hopeful and positive message, without judgement.",,,,,,,,Swapping one addiction for another seems counter intuitive to me.  I am also not sure if e-cigs are quite as positive exchange as they are touted as.,,,,,,,,,,,I think that is just an excuse...it gives one a reason to behave badly around smoking cessation.,,I'm not convinced that this is a good strategy - I feel it is much better to remind yourself that you are now a non smoker - messages like this remind you that you are at heart a smoker,,
176,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,whoa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mhm,,,,,,,,,,,yummy,,no,,It assists me in stopping smoking ,
177,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,while the message reads well i am of the opinion that what is for you wont go by you,,,,,, dont really believe in passive smoking hurting others,this i believe is true so a point though if you have smoked for years the damage cant be repaired,,,,,,,i dont know if  i agree with this as a lot has to do with the enviroment that we love in not just smoking,,i dont believe this if you are going to get lung cancer you will get it whether you smoke or not,as wth the previous queston i am of the opinion that what is for you wont go by you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
178,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I like that it makes quitting look easier by giving time limits to the withdrawal process. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Everyone knows ecigs are better for health than real ones,Provides an alternative to smoking and says it's effectiveness ,Provides optimism and encouragement,Provides hope and a solution but I don't like the idea of having g to visit the doctor. These things should be easily available to buy. ,,,,,It seems the same old message that is always said.,,,,,,,
179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sometimes people can be more motivated to do something for others than for themselves and I'm one of those so this is encouraging, but I don't tend to smoke around others who do not smoke.",,,This doesn't really motivate me as I don't have any children at home and never smoke around children.,,,At 50 I'm beginning to worry about my health and being there for family so this is very motivational.,,,,Very encouraging to know such an important benefit that will happen after one year!,,,,,"It feels like when you decide to stop smoking you are going into something very difficult and with a fear of failure so the pressure is huge and with a busy, stressful lifestyle you keep putting it off! This message helps take away some of the pressure, we can consider starting the process towards stopping smoking sooner than we think, it's not a failure to not succeed perfectly.",,,,,,I think most of us know this. Information from GP or pharmacist comes across rather coldly and tends to make me feel like I have a medical problem (which it kind of is) so not very encouraging message.,,,,,,,
180,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I like the fact that it cut the chances of cancer down.,,I didn't realize that the lungs could clean themselves!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I do feel out of breath when I walk for a short while. This is a motivating statement.,"Again, I like the sound of having clean lungs again!",,,,,,,,,,"Why this may work for some people, I tried and it didn't work for me.",,,I've already tried the e-cigarette and found I've cut down on smoking since doing this.,,,,,,
181,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This is useful and encouraging information,I never smoke around friends or amily so would not apply to me personally,,,,,,,,,,,This is encouraging to know,,,,,This is something most people are already aware of,,,,,,,,"I am already aware of this, it would not make much difference",,,,It might be helpful but I need more information about them
182,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I do notice a lack of fitness due to my smoking and to get back some energy would be a major boost to my everyday life,,,,I do feel guilt and even when smoking outdoors I try to stay away from people and blow my smoke straight up in the air to avoid passive smoking,,,,,,,,,,,,See my children grow up and hopefully my future grandchildren as well and be still able to have an active part in there lives,,I have a year long round couch which I know is caused from my smoking so to have clean healthy lungs would be great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes I do try and have a structured action plan for giving up. However the day to day stresses of family and work often mean my best laid plans to not work,,I have tried the replacement therapy and it just does not work for me the only thing is cold turkey,
183,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Didn't know about the drop in lung cancer but understood the other part,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I don't know about the percentages but have heard the risk does drop,Can't imagine the nhs or the government wanting us to live longer,,,,,,,Swapping one for another isn't my idea of quitting,,,,,,I believe that to be true but dread the first weeks or months if going cold turkey ,,"We don't know the long term effects of vaping yet, I haven't heard anything concrete either way",,,,,,
184,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's a clear and factual message that is positive about not smoking rather than negative about smoking, which makes it more attractive ",,,,,,,,,My partner and I decided some time ago not to have children so this message has a minimal impact. I am aware that this is selfish justification but it doesn't sway my opinion ,"This is a far harder message than the first, however because it concerns heart function, it is more powerful. ",,"The hundreds of thousands is a bit patronising - smokers know what they are doing is harmful. Also, I think this message is less impactful as we don't know the circumstances of our death, and we use this as a subliminal excuse",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's helpful but also obvious. Managing giving up is also a personal thing, and could be seen as patronising ",,,,,,,,"Reflecting on the reason behind quitting is positive, and self motivation is powerful when you are convinced by it. ",,
185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Maybe research shows that stress decreases when you quit but personally I find that spending 5-10 minutes smoking gives me time when I don't have to think about the stresses in my life and I can have time to myself to think. I think that if I were to quit I would find it hard to motivate myself to spend the same amount of time where I'm not thinking about the stresses of life,,,,Money is always a good incentive to help people quit,,,,,,,,,,Defining the extra amount of time that people can expect to live longer due to quitting smoking is helpful. It also makes smokers think about their own mortality and helps them to decide if smoking is really worth it,,,This is probably a better message for older smokers who are probably already thinking about their own mortality or who may have already had heart issues. It's probably not such a good message for younger smokers as the effects of heart disease will probably feel quite distant to them,,,,,,,It's a helpful message to show the effect alternatives can have on quitting or reducing smoking,,,"It's a good message for people who are looking to quit smoking or have recently stopped. It let's them know that the physical cravings will pass and it will get easier over time. On the other hand, it can be demoralising for people who try to stop but then relapse. It can make them feel like it's their own fault and that they are weak for not being able to resist",,,,,,,,
186,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,good idea showing someone a timescale in an example might encourage them to consider stopping,,,,,,,,,this is unrealistic not everyone that quits will get these results,,,any information that could help someone is worthwile,the gentle approach works in the example,i think this is better than the very graphic pictures,,,,,,this is also a good idea and am happy that there is no scare tactics in it,,,,,,,,,
187,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Some types of people live on a day to day basis and cant ever think about the future.,,"Again thinking of ""future""  weeks is just not possible  for some people.",This message doesn't motivate me much because there isnt much reward  for  stopping  something I really enjoy.,,I do  worry about weight gain.im very active already,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This is quite a good idea.,,,,,I havent seen any  stats about the dangers of vaping or  e cigarettes,,,,,
188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,it would encourage me to believe i am benefiting my health to quit,,,,,,,,,,the monetary aspect is definitely a big motivating factor.,,this would definitely help as it would put my sons health into my mind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,it would help for the same reason as the first it would help me knowing there are products that can help,,,,when i am trying to quit it is a lot harder with no assistance so this would help me along,,,,it may help it may not if i think about smoking it makes me want to smoke im better just ignoring it all together.,,,
189,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Its not as easy to give up smoking as that i have tried several times and found it really hard ,,,,,I try not to smoke around people that don't smoke ,,Money would be a big motivator in quitting ,,,,I am sterilized so don't plan on any more children ,I am already high risk of having a stroke so quitting smoking isn't going to change that ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I have tried an ecig but I always revert back to a normal cigarette 
190,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I think the only off putting thing is that 10 years is a long time.  Maybe to would be more of a motivation to a younger person.,,,,,,,,,,,I can see why people would find this inspiring but I have no plan to have children.,,,,,It's a good statistic.,,A positive incentive to give up.,,,It's a good thing.,,,This is how I'm planning to quit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
191,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I worry a great deal about how aging smoking is. Showing these figures hits home.,,,,,,,,,This would make me consider quitting.,,,,,,,,,,"I feel like I have failed before, I find this statement reassuring.",,,,These are quite obvious statements and most smokers will have tried this before.,,,I wasnâ€™t aware of how much less harmful e cigarettes are. Showing these statistics would entice me to quit. ,,,,,,I havenâ€™t rated this as highly as a percentage how less harmful they are wasnâ€™t given. 
192,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,at lot of people who have given up - that i have been acquainted with - have died relatively soon after giving up,"again i didn't find the benefits fast enough - not a lot changed but this would seem to be a good motivator, the patches work the best, the novelty wore off",,,,this seems relatively fast - it is a good motivator - but when I have tried i haven't always found the benefits to come quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"no - i didn't have anyone around, and to the cessation people you are just a statistic.",,"it wasn't a money thing or anything else - i had a scare which proved not to be anything in the end.  I tried various times, after a few months, even 8 months, the novelty (if that's the word) wore off, there needs to be more substitutes or even a ban because all you see are smokers and i tried acupuncture.",the patches were the better of the options - but you then have to find something else to do - they helped make me live a different way and helped at the time to make me live differently with varying views on other things such as food tastes and types of substitutes,
193,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fact,,,,,,,,,,No comment,,,,,,,,Good to know,,Great advice ,,,,My Gp no longer prescribes these smoking alternatives,,,,,,,I would never use an e-cigarette as there is not enough research on the effects it can cause long term,,,,,
194,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The message only appeals to those on low incomes. ,,,The message is motivating because it mentions the health impact of friends and family. ,,,,,,,,,The message focuses on health. ,,,,E cigarettes are a healthier option. ,,,,,,,,,,,,Having a clear action plan would be beneficial. ,"Regular reminders, by reading the list, would be a good motivational tool to stop smoking.

195,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although this is accurate, I currently would not have an equivalent immediate release of dopamine/serotonin akin to nicotine, the thought of not having that now even stresses me.",,,"Concerns me, but I feel it isn't the most off-putting thing about smoking as it is more superficial than some other effects.",,,,,,,"The argument bringing potential children into the scenario certainly forces me to think about other perspectives, although since I may or may not have them, it's currently less compelling than the questions of immediate health.",,,,,,,"By emphasis the benefits of stopping in the future, rather than reflecting the damage already done by smokers, resonates positively. I like questions of 'what can I do now?', rather than 'what I have done/am doing?'. ",,,,,"Again like the last statement, this one reinforces the positive message that quitting is attainable, rather than focus on the negative effects symptomatic of smoking which I already am aware of.",,,,,,"This statement turns stopping smoking, something I equate to an extreme challenge, to something more realistic and manageable and therefore it gives me hope of stopping.",,,,,,,
196,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,some people don't care about others,,,,relatively effective,,,,they could also include more layman terms and strong words such as death,very effective,,,,,,,,,,,,,not everyone knows what cold turkey means,it would be better if they added any helplines,,,,,,,,,,
197,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yes, I am aware of these claims. It is useful to bear in mind.",,I would want more facts and evidence about this kind of statement.,"It is reassuring to think that most people don't put on weight, but I would want a more exact figure and evidence, because I don't think it's true.",,,,"I think all smokers think about how much they spend. It is like stating the obvious, as if smokers are too dumb too count, as is therefore bordering on being extremely patronising.",,,,,,,,,"I think most smokers already know this, but it is useful to be reminded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I think this is misleading. This comparison only holds if comparing with overpriced brands. Buying less branded or generic gum and similar will also cost Â£8 a week or less.,
198,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I would like to stop smoking but find it really hard ,,,,,,I don't smoke near other people I always smoke outside ,,,,,,,,,,This really makes me want to stop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I have stopped before and then started again ,,,I have tried e cigs and I don't like them,I would definitely have the support ,,,,
199,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Maybe some quantifiable measurement related to the blood oxygen level, to give it some weight. It could mean anything in the way it is stated there. It wouldn't concern me as I don't know what it means.  I don't notice any difference in my sense of taste or smell, smoking or not, that said I don't smoke in the week usually.",,"I never put on weight, not concerned about that idea really.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sounds pretty promising. ,,Last time I cut myself it took a long time to stop bleeding. Would prefer my blood to clot at some point.,,"E cigarettes taste horrid. Also, how bad are they for you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Because they taste awful. I'd rather just straight up stop. Also you don't end up looking like the smug e-cig smokers.
200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I have a young child (I never smoke around him) but my son is happy and healthy and I smoked before I found out I was pregnant. The moment I knew I was pregnant I stopped smoking. In the future I would like to have another baby but I would so the same again and stop smoking when I find out I am pregnant.,I am no doctor so I couldn't tell you the main causes of stroke heart attacks etc but I have known the fittest and healthiest people to have had both of these and they have never touched a cigarette. ,If I knew this before I fell pregnant I would have definetly stopped as I would never want anything to harm my unborn child. ,I believe this to some extent but I know many smokers who are in their 90's and still going strong. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I do agree with this statement... apparently it takes 21 days to break a habbit. ,,,My partner vapes and now he can't stand the smell of a cigarette and can't take one. I do think vaping has it's benefits but no one is 100% sure yet. ,,,,,,
